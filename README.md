# rustic-secure-transfer
Rustic Secure Transfer is my personal open-source project, crafted with Rust for secure, direct file sharing. This CLI tool embodies my commitment to combining ease of use with robust security, using encryption for safe, peer-to-peer file transfers without intermediary servers. It's a testament to my passion for secure software development and the power of community collaboration.
